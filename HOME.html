Soon the lamp of knowledge began to spread its radiance far and wide. The institute is committed to adopt the changes in Engineering Education and strongly believes in and strives to strengthen the Technical Education. The highest quality of VJITâ€™s academics is mirrored in the consistent 95% academic results. The institution registers an average of 82% placements for eligible students.
